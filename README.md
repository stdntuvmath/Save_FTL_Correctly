# Save_FTL_Correctly
For all you Faster Than Light (FTL) gamers out there. This simple C# desktop app will allow you to save and load saves so that you don't have to start your game over when you die.

Saving Instructions:
1. Start FTL (in whatever format - I use steam)
2. Start Save_FTL_Correctly
3. As you are playing FTL, press the "Save" button on the Save_FTL_Correctly app. This will save at that point.
4. When you die, go back to the home screen in FTL. Press the "Load" button on the Save_FTL_Correctly app. This will load your saved spot.
